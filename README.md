# KotlinMvpTemplateGenerator
Android Studio template for Kotlin with MVP + Dagger2 + Retrofit2

[You can find related architecture repo here](https://github.com/burakeregar/KotlinMvpArchitecture)

You need to copy all of the template files under 
../YourAndroidStudioDirectory/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities/KotlinMvpTemplate

After that, you need to open/reopen Android Studio.

Create your package.

Now you are ready to create your classes from the template;

Make sure that you write the correct package name

Then magic will happen!

You just need to import 'R' and click on the "Make Project" to let Dagger create required injection classes.
